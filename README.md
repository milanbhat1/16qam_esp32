# QAM Modulation and Demodulation using ESP32

---

## Project Overview
This project implements a **16-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) digital communication system** using two ESP32 microcontrollers. One ESP32 operates as the **transmitter**, generating QAM symbols from digital input data, while the other functions as the **receiver**, demodulating the received symbols and reconstructing the original bit sequence.

The system uses **ESP-NOW**, a low-latency peer-to-peer wireless protocol, to transmit discrete **In-phase (I)** and **Quadrature (Q)** symbol values. This project provides a practical realization of communication system theory on embedded hardware.

## Objectives
- Implement 16-QAM modulation and demodulation on ESP32  
- Understand I–Q representation and constellation mapping  
- Perform wireless data transmission using ESP-NOW  
- Apply nearest-neighbor symbol detection  
- Reconstruct transmitted digital data  
- Provide a base for BER and performance analysis

## System Description

### Transmitter (TX ESP32)
- Binary input provided using two push buttons  
  - Button 0 → binary `0`  
  - Button 1 → binary `1`  
- Bits are appended MSB-first into a 16-bit buffer  
- After collecting 16 bits:  
  - Data is divided into four 4-bit symbols  
  - Each symbol is mapped to a 16-QAM constellation point  
- Each transmitted packet contains:  
  - Packet ID  
  - Number of symbols (4)  
  - I and Q symbol arrays  
- Packets are transmitted using ESP-NOW  

---

### Receiver (RX ESP32)
- Receives packets via ESP-NOW  
- Extracts I and Q values from packets  
- Quantizes received symbols to the nearest constellation level  
- Converts each symbol back into 4 bits  
- Reconstructs the original 16-bit word  
- Displays decoded symbols and bits via serial output  
- Includes a framework for BER and word-error analysis

## QAM Mapping Scheme

### Bit-to-Level Mapping

| Bits | Level |
|------|-------|
| 00   | −3    |
| 01   | −1    |
| 10   | +1    |
| 11   | +3    |

- First two bits map to the **I component**  
- Last two bits map to the **Q component**  
- Each symbol carries **4 bits**  
- One packet carries **4 symbols = 16 bits**

## Source Code

### Transmitter Code
The transmitter ESP32 collects binary input using push buttons, maps the data to 16-QAM symbols, and transmits the symbols wirelessly using ESP-NOW.

### Receiver Code
The receiver ESP32 demodulates the received QAM symbols using nearest-neighbor detection, reconstructs the transmitted bit stream, and displays decoded data via the serial monitor.
